</div>
<p class="story-quote">
          WestTechHA started as a veteran’s quest to build the kind of smart-home gear he actually
          wanted in his own house—local, reliable, and understandable.
        </p>
<p>
          After years of tinkering with ESP32 boards, Home Assistant, Ethernet modules, and
          3D-printed enclosures, that personal project grew into a line of hardened automation
          panels for garages, sprinklers, and whole-home control.
        </p>
<p>
          Every WestTechHA panel is built around the same principles: Ethernet-first stability,
          verified firmware, and clear documentation so DIYers and homeowners can own their
          automation instead of guessing at it.

<div class="section-title">Why Our Panels Are Different</div>
</div>
<div class="subheading">Ethernet-First Reliability</div>
<p>
          Wherever possible, our panels run on wired Ethernet using proven LAN8720-based designs,
          with Wi-Fi as a backup path. These are meant to behave like infrastructure, not
          disposable cloud gadgets.
        </p>
<div class="subheading">Verified Firmware &amp; Stable Baselines</div>
<p>
          We treat firmware like a real product release, not a random config file. Every WestTechHA
          panel runs on versioned, stable-tested ESPHome configurations with features like advanced
          auto-close logic, buzzer pre-warn cycles, and resilient timekeeping. Nothing is shipped
          until it has been exercised on real hardware under real conditions.
        </p>
<div class="subheading">DIY-Friendly &amp; Installer-Conscious</div>
<p>
          Our panels are built for people who care about how things are wired and documented.
          We provide clear GPIO maps, sensible terminal layouts, and hardened 3D-printed enclosures
          designed for actual garages, basements, and structured media panels.
        </p>
<div class="subheading">Safety &amp; Local Control First</div>
<p>
          Especially in the garage, safety matters more than gimmicks. GAP integrates door reeds,
          obstruction beams, motion sensors, and audible warnings so that auto-close decisions are
          made with context and redundancy. Logic runs locally on the panel and integrates with
          Home Assistant without depending on a third-party cloud.
        </p>
<div class="subheading">Displays Where They Matter</div>
<p>
          GAP and SAP panels feature a front-facing 20×4 I2C LCD so you can see system status at a
          glance: door state, timers, zones, and network status. Other panels use compact OLED
          displays for diagnostics and installer information. You shouldn’t have to open an app
          just to know what your panel is doing.
        </p>
<div class="subheading">Transparent by Design</div>
<p>
          We believe in transparency. Our designs are built around open tools like ESPHome and
          Home Assistant, with configuration and wiring intended to be shared, understood, and
          maintained long-term. As WestTechHA grows, our goal is to provide customers and installers
          with access to stable firmware images, wiring guides, and enclosure models so systems
          stay supportable for years.

<div class="section-title">Who We Build For</div>
</div>
<p>
          WestTechHA panels are designed for:
        </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DIY homeowners</strong> who want a serious, local-first alternative to cloud-only gadgets.</li>
<li><strong>Smart-home enthusiasts and makers</strong> who love ESP32 projects but don’t want to reinvent enclosures, wiring, and safety logic from scratch.</li>
<li><strong>Small integrators and tech-savvy friends</strong> who install panels for others and need reliable, well-documented hardware to stand behind.</li>
</ul>
<p class="muted">
          If you care about how things are wired, labeled, and supported—not just how they look in
          an app—WestTechHA is building hardware for you.
